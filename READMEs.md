# ROC_Curve_Model


In machine learning, the ROC curve is an evaluation metric that measures the performance of a machine learning model by visualizing, especially when data is skewed



ROC curves (receiver operating characteristic curves) are an important tool for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. They are most commonly used for binary classification problems â€“ those that have two distinct output classes.
